# towergrove2018
Dylan's planning for next year.

# near-tower patch
* strawberries (in sunny part)
* garlic (in shady part)
* greens (chard, kale, collards)
* tomatoes

# rooftop + southern tower wall
* good place for your berries
* good place for [jerusalem artichokes](http://www.survivallandusa.com/Helianthus-Tuberosus-Jerusalem-Artichoke-Edible.html) (full sun plus a bit quarantined from taking over other beds)
* hops (anchor twine in the roof plants' buckets and drape it down)
* cucumbers that (hang down off the building)[http://www.gardenguides.com/99814-grow-cucumbers-hanging-baskets.html]
* also maybe do this with summer squash
* can you drip-irrigate here?

# rootbuckets (for the shady areas)
* Grow root vegetables (carrots, potatoes, etc) in sandy soil, most likely in tupperware bins
* put ollas in the bins (decreasing water requirement)
* properly sealed and lidded terra cotta pots will also do fine as ollas
* taters
* beets
* put onions in with the carrots (but not the potatoes)

# corn patch
* sweet corn
* edamame (is a good companion plant, mulch prevents the need for weeding)
* [cotton](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/herbs/cotton/cotton-growing-kids.htm) - will maybe companion with the corn, and you can use it in your aquaponics system

# native plant bed
* keep agressive weedy stuff here to minimize weeding elsewhere
* amaranth/pigweed (for grain)
* lamb's quarters
* virginia pepperweed
* mint?

# botanicals
* shiso
* echinacea
* wild lettuce

# data
* Keep track of the percent of your food that comes from the city for a month. (by mass?)

# automated sprinkler
* sprinkler that turns on when soil moisture is too low
* [solenoid sprinkler valve](https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Solenoid-Valve-Magnetic-Switch/dp/B01EFR2OPC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1508214425&sr=8-4&keywords=electric+sprinkler)
* [arduino moisture sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Phantom-YoYo-compatible-Sensitivity-Moisture/dp/B00AFCNR3U/ref=sr_1_1?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1508214661&sr=1-1&keywords=arduino+moisture+sensor)
* arduino setup would look cool inside of a [plastic dome](https://www.amazon.com/TELESIN-Transparent-Cover-Underwater-Photography/dp/B014ULW1UQ/ref=pd_sim_421_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=SZPXGQE1E0TF23WHGE7G)
